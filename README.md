# SortingAlgo.py

#### This repository is a Python project dealing with the visualisation of the sorting algorithms

##### It can be useful if you are searching a **visualisation to better understand how the sorting algorithms work**
##### but also  : 
##### → if you are searching a *Tkinter project with animations* [Tkinter ] 
##### → if you are searching a *TCP socket project sending lists* in the packets [Pickle - Socket - ServerSocket ]

#### Developed using Python 3.7.2 on Windows 10

## If you want the simple application
 → execute the app.py file in application

## If you want the application using TCP socket 
 → execute the sortingServer.py file from the socket folder
 → execute the clientApp.py file from the socket folder
